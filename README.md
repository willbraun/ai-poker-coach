# AI Poker Coach

Poker is a game of incomplete information and luck, so it can be difficult to know if your play is correct. With this app, you can analyze your poker hands using AI fine-tuned with poker information. You're able to review your analysis in English rather than needing to decipher complex diagrams via traditional methods of poker study.

## Features

- Analyze your poker hands with an OpenAI Assistant powered up with poker knowledge
- Learn from other players' hands in a social media-style feed. Usernames are hidden so that your playing style isn't revealed ðŸ˜Ž
